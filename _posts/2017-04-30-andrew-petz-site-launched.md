I've been meaning to re-do my website for a long time.

First, I had it set up with PHP and Bootstrap, and I thought it was great. Then I started my first full-time job at [Ashley Furniture](http://ashleyfurniture.com) as a .NET web developer, and I decided that I wanted to do it over in .NET. Well, that didn't work out so well, as you can see by going to [my old website](http://andrewpetz.com).

Now I've decided to go with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator that works off of file/folder layouts and text files. I am writing this post using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and it will be automagically built as an HTML page when I push the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nannooskeeska/nannooskeeska.github.io).

In other words, pretty cool stuff.
