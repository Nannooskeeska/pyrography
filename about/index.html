<h1>Hey there!</h1>

<p>Thanks for checking out my site. Here's a little more about me.</p>

<p>I'm a 22 year-old programmer from <a href="http://cityofarcadiawi.com">Arcadia, WI</a>. I graduated from the <a href="https://uwec.edu">University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire</a> in May of 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I currently work at <a href="http://www.ashleyfurniture.com">Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc</a> as a full-stack web developer. I work with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net">Microsoft .NET</a> stack, including <a href="https://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2x7h1hfk.aspx">VB.NET</a>, <a href="https://www.javascript.com">Javascript</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016">SQL Server</a>, and HTML/CSS, among other languages and frameworks.</p>

<p>
    Some things about me:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Tabs or spaces?
            <ul>
                <li>Spaces, you heathen.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
